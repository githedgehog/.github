## We're Hedgehog! :hedgehog: :wave:

And we're working on the Open Network Fabric, to bring users the power and
experience from public cloud providers to their private environments. Welcome!

### The Open Network Fabric

The Hedgehog Open Network Fabric is an open networking platform that leverages
the [SONiC network operating system][sonic], provides network connectivity,
tooling, and automation to deploy scalable cloud infrastructure on your
commodity hardware, without vendor lock-in.

The Open Network Fabric is built around the concept of VPCs (Virtual Private
Clouds), similar to public cloud offerings. It provides a multi-tenant API to
define the user intent on network isolation and connectivity, which is
automatically transformed into configuration for switches and software
appliances. Built on top of Kubernetes, the project uses Kubernetes API to
manage its resources, meaning that all user-facing APIs are Kubernetes Custom
Resources (CRDs), so you can use standard Kubernetes tools to manage resources
in the fabric.
